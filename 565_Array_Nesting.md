## 565. Array Nesting (Medium)
A zero-indexed array A of length N contains all integers from 0 to N-1. Find and return the longest length of set S, where S[i] = {A[i], A[A[i]], A[A[A[i]]], ... } subjected to the rule below.

Suppose the first element in S starts with the selection of element A[i] of index = i, the next element in S should be A[A[i]], and then A[A[A[i]]]â€¦ By that analogy, we stop adding right before a duplicate element occurs in S

__Example 1:__
```
Input: A = [5,4,0,3,1,6,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
A[0] = 5, A[1] = 4, A[2] = 0, A[3] = 3, A[4] = 1, A[5] = 6, A[6] = 2.

One of the longest S[K]:
S[0] = {A[0], A[5], A[6], A[2]} = {5, 6, 2, 0}
```
**Note:**
N is an integer within the range [1, 20,000].
The elements of A are all distinct.
Each element of A is an integer within the range [0, N-1].

__Solution:__
![](https://leetcode.com/problems/array-nesting/Figures/565/Array_Nesting.PNG)
- from the figure above, we can see that elements that can be added into a set will form a cycle. It means that no matter which index in the set we start, we will get the same set.
- So we marked the current element visited as we pass by, which result in preventing counting the same set repeatly.
```js
var arrayNesting = function(nums) {
    let max = 0;
    for(let i=0; i<nums.length; i++){
        let count = 0;
        if(nums[i] >= 0){
            let start = nums[i];
            while(nums[start] >= 0){
                let n = start;
                start = nums[n];
                nums[n] = -1;
                count++;
            }
        }
        max = Math.max(max, count);
    }
    
    return max;
};
```
